We are so excited to bring back the Little Miss Tippecanoe Contest.  And, we have added a Little Mister Tippecanoe as well.  Contestants have participated in two workshops learning skills to help them with interviewing, stage presence, friendship and community service.  Join us as we crown a new Little Miss and Mister Tippecanoe and celebrate learning and growing new skills in our young 3rd and 4th grade 4-H'ers.
