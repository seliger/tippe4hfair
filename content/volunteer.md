Thank you for your interest in volunteering with Tippecanoe County 4-H! Without you, we cannot build the next generation of leaders. It takes hundreds of people each year to run our programs, educate our kids, and successfully hold the fair. We have roles for everyone!

## Opportunities

* **Superintendent/Project Leader** - Have some knowledge and a desire to share it? Come lead one of our many projects.
* **Exhibit Association** - By participating on the Exhibit Association board, you help set the stage for the programs and fair offerings we provide.
* **Judges** - Help assess the projects that our members put together each year for the fair.
* **Fair Support** - Set up, tear down, and plenty of opportunities throughout fair week.
* **Many, many, more** - We have many opportunities available.
