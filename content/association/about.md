## About the Exhibit Association

The Tippecanoe County 4-H Exhibit Association is the policy-making board for the 4-H program and has representatives from throughout the county. We facilitate 4-H program planning for Tippecanoe County, ensure the development of accurate and relevant curriculum materials, coordinate and develop hundreds of volunteers that support 4-H and the County Fair, recruit members, and provide oversight over the County Fair.

We believe that investing in our youth and "making the best better" are necessities in an ever-changing world. Our goal is to leverage our skills to create a supportive and encouraging environment for the next generation to challenge themselves and each other to be our next leaders. We do this by finding sponsorship, building community ties, creating events and opportunities, and channeling all of that energy into our youth.

## About Indiana 4-H

4-H began over 100 years ago and has since grown into the largest youth development program in the nation. 4-H prepares young people to be leaders in their community and around the world through hands-on experiences alongside their peers and caring adults. Backed by a network of more than 6 million youth, 540,000 adult volunteers, 3,500 professionals, and more than 60 million alumni; 4-H delivers research-based programming around positive youth development. 4-H is delivered through America’s 109 land-grant universities and the Cooperative Extension Service—reaching every corner of our nation. In Indiana, 4-H can be found in all 92 counties as delivered through Purdue Extension. Community clubs, afterschool programs, school enrichment, camps/workshops, and special programs are all ways youth across Indiana can be involved with the 4-H program.
